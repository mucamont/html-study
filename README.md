In this repository, the focus is on HTML. I can write about mini projects and notes.

9/2/2025 - Today I finish the Unit1.html. I had problems today and I'm tired, but even so, I came to finish this file and to develop discipline.
My english class today was great, I really enjoyed it. Maybe the professor is better than others, or maybe I just like not going there on Saturday.
I just did four math exercises, I'll do more, even if it's late.
